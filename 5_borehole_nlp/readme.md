we hope that we will not bore you with the prentation today!

can we generate a sequence?

soil depths vary - additional layer/weight factor! 
- this is where neo4j could play into this... (use distance between elements)

- jurassic part - never determined that we should - we know that this sequencing can be done... weighting by distances given pre-existing knoweldge of an area..
